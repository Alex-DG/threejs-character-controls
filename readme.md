[Demo](https://threejs-fbx-loader.netlify.app/) (a bit long to load but at the moment it's not optimised for web just know i.e: no draco loader and waiting before all actions to be loaded before showing the model. But it gives you an overview after the loading is done, if you dont want to run the project localy)
