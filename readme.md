# Three.JS FBX Loader

Load FBX character with animations. The 3d model and animations can be found on [mixamo.com](https://www.mixamo.com/) by Adobe.

By pressing on your keyboard: w,a,s,d and shift (turn on/off running mode) or space (start dancing!), you will be able to control the character movements and one special animation!.

[Demo](https://threejs-fbx-loader.netlify.app/) (not yet optimised, ie: No draco loader, waiting before all actions to be loaded before showing the model.). It gives you an overview (after the loading is done!) if you don't want to run the project locally.
